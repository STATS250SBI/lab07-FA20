### Weekly Advice
We're back to working with randomness this week. As before, **your mileage may vary**. When you run code inside of R Markdown (using the play or run buttons in each chunk), you will almost certainly get different results than your collaborators will.

Something interesting we'll learn this week, though, is a technique to make sure that when you Knit your document, you get the *same* results as everyone else. Stay tuned!

**MAKE SURE YOU RUN THE `setup` CHUNK ON LINE 13**

## Lab Tutorial

### Character Vectors
More talk about vectors! This week we're going to talk about *character* vectors (basically, vectors where the elements are text). Here's an example of a character vector:

```{r charVec}
x <- c("hi", "this is", "a character vector.", "Are you impressed?")
x
```
Notice this uses the `c()` function to `c`ombine the elements into a vector, which we call `x`.

Often in this class, we're going to use R to *simulate* studies in order to make inference about populations. Simulation involves doing things over and over again many times, and we're often going to be working with character vectors that repeat the same entry over and over again. Here's an example:

```{r petsExample}
pets <- c("cat", "cat", "cat", "cat", "dog", "dog", "dog", "dog", "dog")
pets
```

We just made a vector called `pets` which contains 4 elements that are "cat" and 5 elements that are "dog". Typing "cat" and "dog" over and over again is tedious. Computers are very good at doing things over and over again, so we'll have R just type "cat" and "dog" a bunch of times for us, using the `rep()` function:

```{r repExample}
cats <- rep("cat", 4)
cats
```

`rep()` takes two arguments: the first is what you want to `rep`eat and the second is the number of times you want it repeated. So `cats` contains the element "cat" 4 times.

We can also use `c()` to `c`ombine multiple `rep`s into one vector!
```{r rep-c}
pets2 <- c(rep("cat", 4), rep("dog", 5))
pets2
```

Notice that `pets2` is exactly the same thing as `pets` from earlier, but we made it with a lot less effort!

The amount of work you save becomes clear when you want to make really big vectors:

```{r bigVectorRep}
table(c(rep("heads", 5000), rep("tails", 5000)))
```
### Functions in Functions in Functions: Oh my!

Okay let's back up and look at the code in that last chunk again, just organized a little differently this time.

```{r bigVectorRep-blowup}
table(
  c(
    rep("heads", 5000),
    rep("tails", 5000)
  )
)
```

Let's unpack this:

- In R, you can put functions *inside* of functions (this is called "nesting"). The innermost function is run first, then we move out from there.
- In this code, we start by `rep`eating "heads" 5000 times, `rep`eating "tails" 5000 times, then `c`ombining those things in a vector with `c()`.
- *Then*, we pass that vector to `table()` to count the number of times "heads" and "tails" show up.
- We saw something like this when we added colors to plots -- we'd use `c()` to create a vector of colors *inside* of a function like `plot()`. 
- We're doing this so we don't have to store the vector (name it) just to tabulate it -- we can create it and pass it to table all in one fell swoop. But, since we didn't give it a name, we can't access it later.

It is **very** important that you "match" parentheses here. Every open parenthesis *must* have a corresponding close parenthesis, and you need to make sure all the arguments to a function go inside that function's parentheses. 

**We recommend that you put all "nested" functions on their own line, like we did in the above chunk.**

### Sampling Revisited
We saw in Lab 4 that we can use `sample()` to simulate die rolls and sampling from vectors of consecutive integers. It turns out we can `sample()` from *any* vector in R.

```{r coinFlipping}
coin <- c('heads', 'tails')
sample(coin, size = 30, replace = TRUE)
```

So there we've mimicked flipping a coin 30 times. Importantly, we've simulated a *fair* coin: `sample()` assumes all elements of the vector we give it have the same probability of being sampled. We can bias the coin using the `prob` argument:

```{r biasedCoin}
sample(coin, size = 30, replace = TRUE, prob = c(0.3, 0.7))
```
We've given `prob` a vector of probabilities for each possible outcome, in the order that they appear in `coin`: P(heads) = 0.3 and P(tails) = 0.7. You should see more tails than heads in the above output

### Pseudo-Random Numbers
It turns out that humans are very bad at generating numbers randomly. Take a look at this word cloud of results from the STATS 250 Student Survey, in which you were asked to provide a random three-digit number. The larger a number is, the more often it showed up in the data.

![](random-numbers.png)

As you can see, people tended to choose 123 a lot, or just typed the same number three times. If these numbers were *truly* random, we'd wouldn't see this -- we'd see most three digit numbers in the data, and each would appear only a few times. 

Computers are *much* better at randomness than humans are, but they're actually still quite bad. "Random" numbers generated by computers are meant to *look* and *seem* random, but, the sequences of numbers they generate are completely predictable if you know where that sequence starts. That starting point is called a **seed**. You can actually choose the seed that your R session will use with a function called `set.seed()`. It's easier to see what this means in practice:

```{r seed}
set.seed(8362)
sample(1:5000, size = 3)
```
Every time you run that chunk, the `sample()` code will draw the **same three numbers** from 1 to 5000: 258, 1834, and 2371. This is because you're setting the seed: you're telling R exactly how to generate numbers, and so it's going to give you the same sequence every single time.


### Line Graphs

In Lab 4, we talked about the law of large numbers, and made a plot of the average of rolls from a six-sided die. The code we used is below.

```{r plotOfMeanOfEx1}
sixSidedDieRoll <- function(n) {
  mean(sample(1:6, size = n, replace = T))
}
plot(sapply(1:300, sixSidedDieRoll), 
     main = "Law of Large Numbers Example",
     xlab = "Number of Six-Sided Dice",
     ylab = "Average")
```

We're going to use that `plot()` code to understand line graphs this week. We can make that plot a line graph by adding the argument `type` to `plot()` and setting it equal to `l` (*that's a lowercase L, not the number 1*). `l` stands for `l`ine.

```{r lineGraphL}
plot(sapply(1:300, sixSidedDieRoll), 
     main = "Law of Large Numbers Example",
     xlab = "Number of Six-Sided Dice",
     ylab = "Average",
     type = "l")
```

If you want your graph to have lines connecting points (instead of just lines like above), you can use `type = o` (lowercase O), and `pch` to choose the point type:

```{r lineGraphO}
plot(sapply(1:300, sixSidedDieRoll), 
     main = "Law of Large Numbers Example",
     xlab = "Number of Six-Sided Dice",
     ylab = "Average",
     type = "o",
     pch = 20)
```

You can change the width of the line using `lwd` (for **l**ine **w**i**d**th): this argument takes numbers that essentially multiply the thickness of the line (so `lwd = 1.5` would be 50% thicker than the default of `lwd = 1`). 

```{r lineGraphLWD}
plot(sapply(1:300, sixSidedDieRoll), 
     main = "Law of Large Numbers Example",
     xlab = "Number of Six-Sided Dice",
     ylab = "Average",
     type = "o",
     pch = 20,
     lwd = 1.5)
```

You can change the "type" of the line using `lty` (**l**ine **ty**pe). From the help page (`?par`):
> Line types can either be specified as an integer (0=blank, 1=solid (default), 2=dashed, 3=dotted, 4=dotdash, 5=longdash, 6=twodash) or as one of the character strings "`blank`", "`solid`", "`dashed`", "`dotted`", "`dotdash`", "`longdash`", or "`twodash`", where "`blank`" uses ‘invisible lines’ (i.e., does not draw them).


```{r lineGraphLTY}
plot(sapply(1:300, sixSidedDieRoll), 
     main = "Law of Large Numbers Example",
     xlab = "Number of Six-Sided Dice",
     ylab = "Average",
     type = "l",
     lty = 4)
```

## Try It!
Depending on your instruction method (in person, synchronous remote, asynchronous remote), complete the following exercises collaboratively. 

1. **In person:** Form groups of 2-4 with those around you (maintaining physical distance). Your instructor will provide additional details.
1. **Synchronous remote:** You will be placed in a Zoom breakout room to work together in small groups. 
1. **Asynchronous remote:** Join a Piazza lab group for asynchronous collaboration.

**Collaborators:** If applicable, replace this text with the names of anyone you collaborated with on this project.


>**1.** In order to make your results reproducible when you knit (so you can compare your answers in the knitted document to your peers'), ***set the seed to 22***.

```{r tryIt1, error = T}
# Replace this comment with code required for Try It 1. (Remember that this text is a comment, so R ignores it; you can delete it if you want.) If you don't delete it, **start your code on a new line that doesn't start with #**

```


> **2.** Using `c()` and `rep()` create a vector containing the word "cat" 35 times and the word "dog" 29 times. Then take a sample of size 20 from that vector with replacement. Show a table of your results. If you get stuck, use the help function in R: type, e.g., `?rep` into the console and hit enter/return.

```{r tryIt2, error = T}
# Replace this comment with code required for Try It 2. (Remember that this text is a comment, so R ignores it; you can delete it if you want.) If you don't delete it, **start your code on a new line that doesn't start with #**

```

> **3.** In the environment pane, you should see a function called `flipCoin()`. If you don't re-run the setup chunk on line 13. This function simulates flipping a possibly biased coin however many times you tell it to. For example, `flipCoin(5)` will flip this coin 5 times. Simulate 5 experiments in which you flip this coin 10 times (i.e., run `flipCoin(10)` 5 times). Based on your result, speculate on whether the coin is fair or biased.

```{r tryIt3, error = T}
# Replace this comment with code required for Try It 3. (Remember that this text is a comment, so R ignores it; you can delete it if you want.) If you don't delete it, **start your code on a new line that doesn't start with #**

```

Replace this text with your answer to Try It 3.

> **4.** Here's some code to plot the number of heads over many simulations. Modify the use of `flipCoin()` so that you plot the results of **100 simulations** of **20 coin flips**. The lines are commented so you know which numbers to change; currently, the code runs 20 simulations of 10 flips. Use the `abline()` function to draw a **blue** horizontal line where you think the average number of heads will be if the coin is **unbiased.** 

**Hint**: *You can make a horizontal line using `abline(h = number)` where `number` is the value you think represents the average.*

```{r tryIt4, error = T}
# Modify the use of flipCoin() so that you plot the results of 100 simulations of 20 coin flips.

plot(replicate(20, # this is the number of simulations you want to run
               table(flipCoin(10))[1]), # this controls number of coin flips per simulation
     type = "l",
     ylab = "Number of heads",
     xlab = "Simulation Number",
     ylim = c(0, 20)) # don't mess with this line
```



## Dive Deeper

> **1.** Use the results of Try It 3 and 4 to discuss whether or not you think the coin is unbiased. If you think the coin is biased (e.g., it's weighted so that heads or tails shows up more often than the other), tell us your guess for the probability of flipping heads. Explain your reasoning in 1-2 sentences.

Replace this text with your written answer for Dive Deeper 1.

> **2.** In Try It 3, you simulated 10 coin flips 5 times. In Try It 4, you simulated 20 coin flips 100 times. What if we simulate 10,000 coin flips one time? Before running the simulation, write down how you think the results might differ from what you did earlier, then run the simulation using `flipCoin()`, then check your intution. 

Replace this text with your prediction: how will one simulation of 10,000 coin flips compare to the process of repeating a smaller number of coin flips many times?

```{r diveDeeper2}
# Replace this comment with code required for Dive Deeper 2. (Remember that this text is a comment, so R ignores it; you can delete it if you want.) If you don't delete it, **start your code on a new line that doesn't start with #**

```

Replace this text with your thoughts on how your simulation turned out.

> **3.** In the lecture notes for section 2.4, we repeated the simulation of flipping a coin 16 times twice. The first time, our 16 coin flips were repeated 100 times. The second time, our 16 coin flips were repeated 1000 times. For your simulation in Dive Deeper 4, how many times will you run it? 100 times? 1000 times? Another number of times? Explain your reasoning.

Replace this text with your written answer to Dive Deeper 3.

> **4.** In the lecture notes for section 2.4, we had a scenario involving Buzz choosing the correct button. We decided to simulate Buzz's selections using a (fair) coin flip where heads represents a correct guess and tails represents an incorrect guess. Think of a scenario in real life where you could also use a repeated (fair) coin flip as a simulation. Cleary define heads and tails. 

Replace this text with your written answer to Dive Deeper 4.

> **5.** Let's play a game. Go to [this website](https://www.expunctis.com/2019/03/07/Not-so-random.html) and scroll down until you see some buttons with arrows. The goal is to hit the arrow buttons (or your arrow keys on your keyboard) as randomly as possible. If the computer guesses your next move, you lose "money" and your line goes down. If the computer guesses wrong, you win, and your line goes up. Play this game for a minute or two, and in 1-2 sentences tell us how you did against the computer and if you learned anything.
